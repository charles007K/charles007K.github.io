<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Since I was young, I have always been fascinated by electronic devices. 
Whenever I got a new device, such as a DVD player, VCD player, or wireless telephone, I would spend a long time understanding how it worked. 
I would carefully read the manual and start using the device, trying to comprehend the functions of different buttons and features. 
I enjoyed gaining new knowledge through this process.<br />

<p>As time went by, I currently entered the audio and visual industry. 
I have helped many companies build their meeting rooms, where I had to install and configure various devices and components, much like what I did in my youth. 
Now, I have over 10 years of experience as a technician in the Audio Visual and Construction industries.
I have proven project management and team leadership experience.
My creative problem-solving and investigative skills enable me to identify complex problems and generate solutions on a weekly basis.</p>
  
<p>I am familiar with various brands and understand their features in the AV industry, including Crestron, Extron, Biamp, Logitech, Cisco, and more.</p>
