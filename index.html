<h2>About This Page </h2>
<p class="font-white" id="paragraph">Over the past few years, I've made many new friends. 
I often find myself at a loss for words when trying to explain my job and its specifics. 
My role doesn't fit neatly into a single title, and explaining it in English has been challenging. 
This frustration led me to think, why not create a webpage to showcase my work and its details? Driven by this idea, I decided to learn web development and coding. 
This page is the result of that motivation.</p><br/>
<p class="font-white" id="paragraph">More I learning it I feel web develop is very interesting,many ideas could allowed on web develop.Hope I can keep learning it.</p><br/>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p class="font-white" id="paragraph">I was young, I have always been fascinated by electronic devices. 
Whenever I got a new device, such as a DVD player, VCD player, or wireless telephone, I would spend a long time understanding how it worked. 
I would carefully read the manual and start using the device, trying to comprehend the functions of different buttons and features. 
I enjoyed gaining new knowledge through this process. </p> <br/>
<p class="font-white" id="paragraph">As time went by, I currently entered the audio and visual industry. 
I have helped many companies build their meeting rooms, where I had to install and configure various devices and components, much like what I did in my youth. 
Now, I have over 10 years of experience as a technician in the Audio Visual and Construction industries.
I have proven project management and team leadership experience.My creative problem-solving and investigative skills enable me to identify complex problems and generate solutions on a weekly basis.</p><br/>
